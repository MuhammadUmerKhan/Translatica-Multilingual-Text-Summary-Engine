## ❓ Problem Statement

Language barriers and lengthy documents often pose challenges for communication and information retrieval. Traditional translation tools may not support all languages effectively, and manual summarization is time-consuming.

This project aims to:
- 📝 **Translate text between multiple languages** using advanced NLP models.
- 📚 **Summarize large text documents** to extract key information.
- 🌐 **Provide an easy-to-use web interface** for real-time translation and summarization.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Text Translation:**
   - Utilize **Facebook's M2M100 model** for multilingual translation.
   - Support translation between various language pairs.

2. **Text Summarization:**
   - Use **Facebook's BART-Large-CNN model** for abstractive summarization.
   - Handle long documents efficiently.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Build an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.
   - Provide dropdown selections for choosing languages.
   - Support text input and file uploads.
